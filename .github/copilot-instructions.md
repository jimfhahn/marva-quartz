# Copilot Instructions: Marva Quartz (Penn Libraries Fork)

## Overview
- **Product**: Web-based BIBFRAME RDF/XML editor used by Penn Libraries for Alma-integrated cataloging.
- **Source**: Fork of the Library of Congress "Marva Quartz" project with Penn-specific search, publishing, and workflow customizations.
- **Primary Goals**:
  1. Load and edit Work/Instance (and optional Item) descriptions that follow the LC BIBFRAME ontology and profile definitions.
  2. Support Penn catalogers by accepting Alma MMSIDs and POD identifiers in addition to LCCNs and raw URLs.
  3. Publish edited descriptions back to Alma/Penn infrastructure with options to send Work + Instance, Work-only, or Instance-only payloads.

## Key User Stories
- *As a cataloger*, I can search for a record by MMSID, POD, LCCN, or direct RDF URL and load it into the editor.
- *As a cataloger*, I can preview, edit, and validate BIBFRAME descriptions using profiles that group fields the way LC does.
- *As a cataloger*, I can export/publish the exact portion of a description that my Alma workflow expects (Instance-only, Work+Instance, etc.).
- *As a systems librarian*, I can point the UI at public LC endpoints for demos or at Penn endpoints for production by editing config values.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Vue 3 (SFCs, mix of Options API + Composition helpers) bundled with Vite.
- **State**: Pinia stores under `src/stores/` for config (`config.js`), preferences (`preference.js`), profiles/data (`profile.js`).
- **Routing**: Vue Router (`src/router`).
- **Styling**: Global CSS in `src/assets/base.css` & `main.css`; component-scoped styles where needed.
- **Utilities**: Extensive helper modules in `src/lib/` for RDF parsing (`utils_parse.js`), network (`utils_network.js`), exports (`utils_export.js`), and misc transformations.
- **Tooling**: Vitest for unit tests (`npm run test:unit`), Cypress for e2e (`npm run test:e2e`), ESLint + Prettier for linting.

## Data & Workflow Notes
- **Profiles**: JSON templates describing how to group BIBFRAME properties into Work/Instance/Item resource templates. Located in `public/profiles*.json`.
- **Loading**: `Load.vue` detects identifier type via `detectSearchType()`:
  - MMSID (starts with `99` + digits) → `quartz.bibframe.app/alma/` endpoint
  - POD (UUID) → `quartz.bibframe.app/pod/<uuid>.xml`
  - URLs → direct fetch
  - Fallback → LC LCCN search via `utils_network.searchInstanceByLCCN`
- **Parsing**: `utils_parse.transformRts()` merges incoming RDF/XML with profile definitions, generates per-RT components, and sets up Items when present.
- **Publishing**: Configurable endpoints (`publish`, `workpublish`, `instancepublish`) per environment. UI allows selecting scope (Work+Instance, Work only, Instance only) in `PostModal.vue`.
- **Saved Records**: Requires back-end (see [`marva-backend`](https://github.com/lcnetdev/marva-backend)). Front-end gracefully handles absence by showing empty states.
- **Validation & Scriptshifter**: Optional services toggled through config flags; expect them to be unreachable in pure local dev.

## Environment & Configuration
- `useConfigStore` determines which `regionUrls` block to use based on hostname (dev/staging/production/bibframe.org/quartz).
- Local development (`npm run dev`) serves on Vite default port (5173). Use `npm run preview` for production-like preview.
- The app tolerates missing backend endpoints; however, avoid removing graceful-degradation logic.
- Feature flags:
  - `publicEndpoints` toggles whether load/publish should expose public LC services
  - `displayLCOnlyFeatures` controls visibility of LC-specific operations
  - `postUsingAlmaXmlFormat` reserved for Penn Alma-specific serialization tweaks

## Coding Guidelines for Agents
1. **Match existing patterns**: Use Vue SFCs with `<script setup>` only where the repo already does; otherwise stick to Options API for consistency.
2. **Keep helpers centralized**: Add shared logic to `src/lib/` modules or Pinia stores rather than scattering utilities in components.
3. **Preserve RDF fidelity**: When modifying parsing/export logic, maintain namespace declarations, blank node structures, and Work ↔ Instance links.
4. **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML, ensure buttons/inputs have labels, and respect existing keyboard navigation.
5. **Internationalization**: Strings are currently hard-coded but prepared for Vue I18n. Store translatable text near existing patterns when possible.
6. **Error handling**: Show user-friendly UI feedback; log details to the console for developers.
7. **Network calls**: Route through `utils_network.js`. Include abort/cancel support for long-running fetches where applicable.
8. **State updates**: Use Pinia store actions/mutations to update shared state. Avoid mutating store state directly outside store definitions.
9. **Testing**:
   - Favor Vitest for unit-level logic (helpers, stores, pure components).
   - Use Cypress for flow/regression tests involving the editor UI.
   - Ensure new features have at least one automated check when they affect critical workflows (load, edit, publish).
10. **Lint & format**: Obey ESLint/Prettier configuration. Run `npm run lint` after substantial changes.

## Common Tasks for Copilot
- **Add new identifier types**: Update `detectSearchType`, extend network helpers, add UI affordances in `Load.vue`.
- **Extend publishing options**: Touch `PostModal.vue`, `utils_export.js`, and relevant config endpoints.
- **Customize profiles**: Modify JSON under `public/` and ensure `profileStore` handles new RT suffixes.
- **Enhance validation**: Integrate additional backend responses without blocking UI if the service is unavailable.
- **Improve accessibility**: Audit components in `components/panels/edit/` for ARIA attributes, keyboard interactions.

## Testing & Quality Gates
- `npm run test:unit` → Vitest (jsdom) under `src/`.
- `npm run test:e2e` → Builds preview server and runs Cypress headlessly.
- `npm run lint` → ESLint/Prettier combo.
- Prefer running relevant script(s) locally before submitting major changes; document skipped checks if backend dependencies prevent full coverage.

## Additional Tips
- The app expects profile JSON to align with LC structure (`lc:RT:` naming). When introducing new templates, update `validTopLevelProfileSufixes` in `config.js` if needed.
- `public/test_files/*.xml` provide offline fixtures. Use them in tests or when backend endpoints are down.
- When altering store defaults (e.g., `versionMajor`), ensure they propagate to UI elements that display version info.
- Keep Penn-specific logic flagged in comments to ease future upstream merges.
- Large edits to profiles or RDF transformations should include before/after XML snippets in PR descriptions for reviewer clarity.
- Penn fork allows `_b` blank nodes captured as literals to be promoted into Hub or Work resources; make sure downstream changes preserve this behavior when touching parsing/export code.
- Admin metadata defaults (assigner org/label) are hard-coded to "University of Pennsylvania, Van Pelt-Dietrich Library" unless `defaultAssignerLabel` is set; adjust intentionally when working on export or admin metadata logic.

## Staying Aligned With Upstream
- **Track Penn deviations**: Key divergences from lcnetdev upstream live in `src/views/Load.vue` (MMSID/POD detection), `src/stores/config.js` (Penn endpoints and feature flags), and publishing components such as `PostModal.vue` / `src/lib/utils_export.js` (Instance-only workflows). Review these first when resolving merge conflicts so Penn-specific behavior persists.
- **Preserve blank-node promotion**: `utils_parse.js`/`utils_profile.js` include logic for promoting `_b` literal nodes into Hub or Work resources—this does not exist upstream. When merging, ensure this custom handling survives.
- **Penn-flavored admin metadata**: `utils_export.js` seeds assigner details with Penn defaults. Preserve or relocate these values to config rather than reverting to LC strings when resolving conflicts.
- **Merge workflow**: When pulling upstream changes, prefer a feature branch and a clean merge or rebase. Resolve conflicts by preserving Penn logic, then re-run unit tests, lint, and a quick manual smoke of MMSID/POD loading plus Instance-only publishing.
- **Environment sanity checks**: After merges, confirm `regionUrls` entries still expose `publicEndpoints`, `displayLCOnlyFeatures`, and `postUsingAlmaXmlFormat` toggles as expected. Ensure default dev config points to working public endpoints.
- **Penn regression checklist**: Verify the following before finishing a sync:
  - Load by MMSID (`99…`) still chats with `quartz.bibframe.app/alma/`.
  - Load by POD UUID fetches from `quartz.bibframe.app/pod/<uuid>.xml`.
  - Instance-only publish option remains available and posts the correct payload.
  - Saved-records dashboard still tolerates absent backend services.
- **Document merges**: Summarize notable upstream changes and any Penn-specific adjustments in the PR description to help future merges.
